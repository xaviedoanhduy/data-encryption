# data-encryption

*** Encryption:

Encryption is the process of encoding the data. i.e converting plain text into ciphertext. This conversion is done with a key called an encryption key.

*** Decryption:

Decryption is the process of decoding the encoded data. Converting the ciphertext into plain text. This process requires a key that we used for encryption.

We require a key for encryption. There are two main types of keys used for encryption and decryption. They are Symmetric-key and Asymmetric-key
